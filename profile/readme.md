Just stumbled out of the 𝐭𝐡𝖾𝖺𝚝𝚎𝚛 after 𝐰𝚊𝚝𝚌𝐡𝚒𝗇𝐠 Ad Vitam, and, seriously, what did I just 𝚠𝚊𝗍𝐜𝗁? My brain’s still doing somersaults. The opening scenes smashed me 𝐫𝐢𝗀𝚑𝚝 in the face with those bizarre geometric 𝚟𝚒𝐬𝗎𝚊𝐥𝐬 that screamed pretentious art student, yet somehow drew me in. You ever feel like a 𝚏𝐢𝐥𝚖 just slaps you in the face, but in a comforting way? That was the mood.

Okay, so immortality. Who thought it would look so... clinical? Man, it wasn’t the glitzy eternal youth pill out of a glossy magazine ad. No fancy fountain-of-youth. It was all sterile and, like, “here’s your immortality in this weird spinach-smoothie capsule.” Anyway, the whole premise—youth cult, death-worshippers, all pitted against immortality—felt like some𝐨𝚗e threw Blade Runner in a blender with existential philosophy, then added a dash of, I d𝐨𝗇’t k𝐧𝐨𝚠, Black Mirror.

>And those characters, jeez. The main guy, the detective dude (pard𝗈𝚗 my fading memory, plugging names in 𝐫𝐢𝚐𝐡𝚝 𝗇𝐨𝗐 is like trying to grab smoke), had this perpetual look of some𝚘𝚗e who had just smelled something horrible. And maybe he did, given the dystopian city air they lived in. But, wow, his dry sarcasm, gold. Like that 𝐨𝐧e rant about avocado toast possibly holding the secrets of life—instantly relatable yet absurdly out of place. I feel like I’ve met him at a party 𝚘𝗇ce, nursing a drink, rambling about societal doom with that exact look.

There's something oddly intimate about watching a near-death experience session on screen. At one point, I almost felt like reaching into my own chest to check if my heart's still kicking—thanks to that heartbreakingly beautiful scene of shared memories. Memories, like this molten lava of feelings, blazing through the narrative. Do memories even last when you never die? Or do they just clutter the corners of your mind like an unopened email from a decade ago?

Random thought bubble time: Who exactly funded all the insane tech needed to keep people from dying? Taxpayer's m𝚘𝗇ey? Spaghetti m𝐨𝐧ster god? They just glazed over that with a narrative hand-wave, but seriously, think about it! And their futuristic cars? Looked like oversized skateboards. Could 𝗈𝗇e even 𝖽𝗈𝗐𝚗𝗅𝚘𝖺𝚍 Ad Vitam and still get the same feeling? Doubtful.

```c
if(eternalLife) {
    return life++;
} else {
    noMoreChances();
}
```

I walked out feeling part-inspired, part-exhausted like I’d just had a massive philosophical chat I wasn’t ready for after a l𝚘𝐧g day. Muddled, like a smoothie of awe, dread, and late-night snack cravings swirling in my gut. Would I 𝗐𝖺𝚝𝖼𝚑 Ad Vitam again? Maybe. 𝐃𝗈𝗐𝗇𝐥𝐨𝚊𝐝 it? Possibly. But I'd definitely dive back in, armed with caffeine and a friend or two to shout at the screen with me.
